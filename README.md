# WP Simple Contact Form (shortcode)

This plugin has been explained in [this TutsPlus post]( http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/creating-a-simple-contact-form-for-simple-needs--wp-27893)
and I'm not the author ( [Barış Ünver](http://wp.tutsplus.com/author/barisunver/) )
but I thought it would be good idea to improve this simple plugin.

Just install the plugin and use it as shortcode [contact yourmail@yourdomain.com],
also you don't need to worry about (some) spam bots, because it is filtered by
to simple techniques: hidden input and timestamp submit.
